  <h1 class="backdrop about">About</h1>
  <p>Hi! My name is <strong>Enrico Campidoglio</strong>. I’m a <a href="/services/">programmer</a>, <a href="/speaking/">speaker</a> and <a href="/workshops/">trainer</a> with a strong passion for quality and good old-fashioned knowledge sharing.</p>

  <p>As of <a href="/2017/09/13/the-next-step/">late 2017</a>, I work as a <a href="/services/">freelance programmer, teacher and mentor</a> helping teams develop software <em>better</em>. If you think I can help you, I'd love to <a href="/services/#contact">hear from you.</a></p>

  <h2 id="my_mission">My Mission</h2>

  <p>I believe in always improving — whether it's code or the teams I work with. Inspired by the <a href="https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_08/">"Boy Scout Rule"</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin">Robert C. Martin</a>, I aim to leave every project better than I found it.

  <h2 id="what_i_do">What I Do</h2>

  <p>I've been teaching technical subjects since 2004, starting with a Linux programming class while working as a consultant. Over the years, I’ve led internal courses for companies alongside my consulting work.</p>

  <p>In 2017, I decided to fully focus on what I enjoy most: teaching and mentoring. While programming remains at the core of what I do, I now split my time between writing code and helping others grow through <a href="/services">mentoring and training</a>.</p>

  <h3>Speaking</h3>

  <p>Since 2011, I’ve had the privilege of <a href="/speaking">speaking</a> at conferences and user group events around the world. <a href="/speaking">My talks</a> are typically technical, but I always aim to make them engaging and accessible. I believe that sharing knowledge is about more than just explaining concepts — it’s about inspiring others to think differently and approach problems with a fresh perspective.</p>

  <h3>Online Courses</h3>

  </a>

  <p>Since 2011, I help maintain <a href="https://github.com/AutoFixture" target="_blank">AutoFixture</a>, an open source library for .NET that helps alleviate some of the friction experienced when doing Test-driven development by making it easier to generate test data.</p>

  <p>In 2020, I joined the <a href="https://github.com/cake-build">Cake core team</a>, where I'm responsible for maintaining the <a href="https://github.com/cake-build/cake-action">Cake GitHub Action</a>, which I created during the production of my <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/building-custom-github-actions">Building Custom GitHub Actions Pluralsight course</a>.</p>

  <p>I'm also the author of <a href="https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.Curl" target="_blank">Cake.Curl</a>, a cross-platform addin for <a href="https://cakebuild.net">Cake (C# Make)</a> that allows you to transfer data to a remote URL as part of your build script using <a href="https://curl.se" target="_blank">curl</a>.</p>
