  <h1 class="backdrop about">About</h1>
  <p>Hi! My name is <strong>Enrico Campidoglio</strong>. Iâ€™m a <a href="/services/">programmer</a>, <a href="/speaking/">speaker</a> and <a href="/workshops/">trainer</a> with a strong passion for quality and good old-fashioned knowledge sharing.</p>

  <p>As of <a href="/2017/09/13/the-next-step/">late 2017</a>, I work as a <a href="/services/">freelance programmer, teacher and mentor</a> helping teams develop software <em>better</em>. If you think I can help you, I'd love to <a href="/services/#contact">hear from you.</a></p>

  <h2 id="my_mission">My Mission</h2>

  <p>Let me start by telling you an interesting fact about me: I've been a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scouting" target="_blank">scout</a> for almost 10 years of my life. It was between age 9 and 19, so pretty much my formative years. In retrospect, it was a <em>great experience</em>, even though I didn't always think of it that way at the time. Anyway, you may have heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Baden-Powell,_1st_Baron_Baden-Powell" target="_blank">Lord Robert Baden-Powell</a> â€” he was a lieutenant general in the British Army who, in 1907, founded the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scouting" target="_blank">Scouting movement</a> based on the motto <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_Motto#Baden-Powell_on_.22Be_Prepared.22" target="_blank"><em>"Be Prepared"</em></a>. And being prepared is exactly what they teach you at the scouts.</p>

  <p>Another thing you learn from being a scout comes from another of Baden-Powell's mottos: <em>leave this world a little better than you found it</em>.</p>

  <img class="thumbnail-article" alt="A fleur-de-lis positioned on a trefoil, in the original Scouting colors chosen by Lord Baden-Powell" src="/assets/about/scouting_fleur-de-lis.png" style="width: 110px; height: auto; margin-left: 4%; box-shadow: none;"/>

  <p>That idea always spoke to me because it gives meaning to so many things in life.</p><p>Eventuallyâ€”and perhaps unsurprisinglyâ€”it even found its way to programming thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin" target="_blank">Robert C. Martin</a>. Martin took it to heart and transformed it into a rule for professional programmers to live by: <em>always check a module in cleaner than when you checked it out</em>. The <a href="http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Boy_Scout_Rule" target="_blank">Boy Scout Rule</a> was born.</p>

  <p>Naturally, I'm a big fan of the Boy Scout Rule. So much so, in fact, that I like to apply it to more than just code: I apply it to teams as well.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>When I join a project, I want to <em>leave the team in better shape than I found it</em>.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I've <a href="/2016/06/20/on-being-a-good-dotnet-developer/">said it in the past</a> and I'll say it again: as programmers, we can't possibly know everything. There's is simply too much information for any single person to absorb. So, if you do have some knowledge about a topic, it's your <em>obligation</em> to pass it on as much as you can to your fellow programmers. That's the only chance we have to grow in our profession: by sharing knowledge.</p>

  <p>Now, I realize that not everyone has the desire or the inclination to be a teacher. That's fine. I, for one, <em>love teaching</em> and I think I'm <a href="/speaking">pretty good at it</a>, so I made it my mission.</p>

  <h2 id="what_i_do">What I Do</h2>

  <p>There are many ways to teach technical subjects. I started out in 2004 by teaching a Linux programming class in a local continuing education program. I was a consultant back then and that was my first <em>real</em> teaching job. I was excited. Although I would regularly lose my voice at the end of each day, I found the experience <em>very compelling</em>. So I kept at it. In the following years, I would hold many internal courses for private companies between my regular consulting assignments.</p>

  <p>Eventually, in late 2017, I decided that teaching and mentoring was what I really wanted to do, so I made it my full time job by becoming <a href="/services">a freelancer</a>. Of course, I'm first and foremost a <em>programmer</em>, so I also write code both as part of my job as well as for open source projects.</p>

  <h3>Speaking</h3>

  <p>I've been <a href="/speaking">speaking</a> at conferences and user groups events around the world since 2011. My talks are usually pretty technical, but I try to keep things interesting by squeezing in as much humor as I can. While doing that, I also learned that humor is an extremely <em>local</em> thing and that the line between laughter and tumbleweed is surprisingly thin. ðŸ˜³</p>

  <h3>Blogging</h3>
  
  <p>In 2008, I started <a href="/">this blog</a> as an outlet for sharing narrower topics that wouldn't necessarily be enough for a talk or a course. Ironically, many of the ideas that I ended up presenting actually started out as blog posts. If you want to get a sense for what I write about, you're welcome to check out my most popular articles on the <a href="/bestof">best-of page</a>.</p>

  <h3>Pluralsight</h3>

  <p>In 2015, I started producing online training for <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com" target="_blank">Pluralsight</a>. You can find my curriculum of courses on my <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/enrico-campidoglio" target="_blank">author page</a>.</p>

  <h3>Open Source</h3>

  <p>Since 2011, I help maintain <a href="https://github.com/AutoFixture" target="_blank">AutoFixture</a>, an open source library for .NET that helps alleviate some of the friction experienced when doing Test-driven development by making it easier to generate test data.</p>

  <p>I'm also the author of <a href="https://github.com/ecampidoglio/Cake.Curl" target="_blank">Cake.Curl</a>, a cross-platform addin for <a href="https://cakebuild.net">Cake (C# Make)</a> that allows you to transfer data to a remote URL as part of your build script using <a href="https://curl.haxx.se" target="_blank">curl</a>.</p>
