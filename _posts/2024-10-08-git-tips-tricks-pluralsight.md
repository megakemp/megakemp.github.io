_Git is more than just a tool—it’s a Swiss Army knife packed with hidden gems! In my new [Git Tips and Tricks](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/git-tips-tricks) course at [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/enrico-campidoglio), I’ll show you how to unlock Git’s full potential._

In 2016, I released [my first Pluralsight course](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/enrico-campidoglio) on Git. Since then, Git has evolved—and so have I. That’s why I’m thrilled to introduce my brand-new course [Git Tips and Tricks](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/git-tips-tricks), showcasing the latest features and techniques of modern Git that can supercharge your workflow.

Whether you're navigating [complex histories](/2014/08/14/the-importance-of-a-good-looking-history/) or [correcting mistakes](/2016/08/25/git-undo/), this course has everything you need to level up your Git game. I'm really proud of how it turned out, and if Git is part of your daily life, I think you’re going to love it!
