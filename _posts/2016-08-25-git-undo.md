Tell me if you recognize this scenario: you're in the middle of [rewriting your local commits](http://megakemp.com/2014/08/14/the-importance-of-a-good-looking-history) when you suddenly realize that you have gone too far and, after one too many rebases, you are left with a history that looks nothing like the way you wanted. No? Well, I certainly do. And when that happens, I wish I could just <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> my way back to where I started. Of course, it's never that simple — not even in [a GUI](https://vimeo.com/171317261).

It was in one of those moments of despair that I finally decided to set out to create my own `git undo` command. Here's what I came up with and how I got there.

## The Reflog

My story of undoing things in Git starts with the reflog. _What's the reflog_, you might ask. Well, I'm here to tell you: every time a [_branch reference_](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References) moves[^1] Git records its previous value in a sort of local journal. This journal is the called the _reference log_ — or [reflog][reflog-doc] for short.

In a repository there is a reflog for _each branch_ as well as a separate one for the `HEAD` reference.

Getting the list of entries in a branch's reflog is as easy as saying `git reflog` followed by the name of the branch:

    git reflog master

shows the reflog entries for the `master` branch:

<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/{{ page.assets }}/git-reflog-master.png">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/{{ page.assets }}/git-reflog-master.png"
     alt="Output of git-reflog for the master branch"
     title="Output of git-reflog for the master branch"
     class="screenshot" />
</a>

If you instead wanted to look at `HEAD`'s own reflog, you would simply omit the argument and say:

    git reflog

which yields the same output, only for the `HEAD` reference:

<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/{{ page.assets }}/git-reflog-head.png">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/{{ page.assets }}/git-reflog-head.png"
     alt="Output of git-reflog for the HEAD reference"
     title="Output of git-reflog for the HEAD reference"
     class="screenshot" />
</a>

What isn't immediately obvious is that the entries in the reflog are stored in _reverse chronological order_ with the most recent one on top.

What _is_ obvious, on the other hand, is that each entry has its own _index_. This turns out to be _extremely_ useful, because we can use that index to directly reference the commit associated to a certain reflog entry. But more on that later. For now, suffice it to say that in order to reference a reflog entry, we have to use the syntax:

    reference@{index}

where the two parts separated by the `@` sign are:

- `reference` which can either be the name of a branch or `HEAD`
- `index` which is the entry's position in the reflog[^2]

For example, let's say that we wanted to look at the commit `HEAD` was referencing _two positions ago_. To do that, we could use the `git show` command followed by `HEAD@{2}`:

    git show HEAD@{2}

If we, instead, wanted to look at the commit `master` was referencing just _before the latest one_ we would say:

    git show master@{1}

## The Undo Alias

Here's my point: the [reflog][reflog-doc] keeps track of the history of commits referenced by a branch, just like a web browser keeps track of the history of URLs we visit.

<div class="note">
<p>
<i class="fa fa-bullhorn fa-2x pull-left"></i>
This means that the commit referenced by <code>@{1}</code> is <em>always</em> the commit that was referenced <em>just before the current one</em>.
</p>
</div>

If we were to combine the reflog with the [`git reset`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset) command like this:

    git reset --hard master@{1}

we would suddenly have a way to move `HEAD`, the _index_ and the _working directory_ to the previous commit referenced by a branch. This is essentially the same as [_pressing the back button_](http://stackoverflow.com/q/1313788/26396) in our web browser!

At this point, we have everything we need to implement our own `git undo` command, which we do in the form of an [alias][alias-doc]. Here it is:

```shell
git config --global alias.undo '!f() { \
    git reset --hard $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)@{${1-1}}; \
}; f'
```

I realize it's quite a mouthful so let's break it down piece by piece:

1. `!f() { ... } f`<br/>
Here, we're defining the alias as a _shell function_ named `f` which is then invoked immediately.

2. `$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)@{...}`<br/>
We use the [`git rev-parse`][rev-parse-doc] command followed by the `--abbrev-ref` option to get the name of the current branch reference, which we then concatenate with `@{...}` to form the reference to a previous position in the reflog (e.g. `master@{1}`).

3. `${1-1}`<br/>
We specify the position in the reflog as the first parameter `$1` with a default value of `1`. This is the whole reason why we defined the alias as a shell function: to be able to provide a default value for the parameter using the standard [Bash syntax](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Shell-Parameter-Expansion).

The beauty of using an optional parameter like this, is that it allows us to undo any number of operations. At the same time, if we don't specify anything, it's going to undo the just latest one.

## Trying It Out

Let's say that we have a history that looks like this:[^3]

<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/{{ page.assets }}/git-lg-before.png">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/{{ page.assets }}/git-lg-before.png"
     alt="History before the rewrite"
     title="History before the rewrite"
     class="screenshot" />
</a>

We have two branches — `master` and `feature` — that have diverged at commit `C`. For the sake of our example, let's also say that we wanted to remove the latest commit in `master` — that is commit `F` — and then merge the `feature` branch:

    git reset --hard HEAD^
    git merge feature

At this point, we would end up with a history looking like this:

<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/{{ page.assets }}/git-lg-after.png">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/{{ page.assets }}/git-lg-after.png"
     alt="History after the rewrite"
     title="History after the rewrite"
     class="screenshot" />
</a>

As you can see, everything went fine — but we're still not happy. For some reason, we want to go back to the way history was before. In practice, this means we need to undo our latest _two_ operations: the _merge_ and the _reset_. Time to whip out that `undo` alias:

    git undo 2

This moves `HEAD` to the commit referenced by `master@{2}` — that is the commit the `master` branch was pointing to _2 reflog entries ago_. Let's go ahead and check our history again:

<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/{{ page.assets }}/git-lg-restored.png">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/{{ page.assets }}/git-lg-restored.png"
     alt="History restored with the undo alias"
     title="History restored with the undo alias"
     class="screenshot" />
</a>

And everything is back the way it was. \o/

But what if wanted to _undo the undo_? Easy. Since `git undo` itself creates an entry in the reflog, it's enough to say:

    git undo

which, without argument, is the equivalent of saying `git undo 1`.

<div class="note">
<p>
<i class="fa fa-play-circle-o fa-2x pull-left pull-left-three-lines"></i>
Did you find this useful? If you're interested in learning other techniques like the one described in this article, I wrote down a few more in my <a href="http://bit.ly/ps-enrico-campidoglio">Pluralsight</a> course <a href="http://bit.ly/git-tips-tricks">Advanced Git Tips and Tricks</a>.

[^1]: That is, it's _modified_ to point to a different commit than it did before.
[^2]: You can also use _dates_ here. Try for example `master@{yesterday}` or `HEAD@{2.days.ago}` — pretty amazing, don't you think?
[^3]: I like my history succinct and colorful. For this reason, I never use the plain `git log`; instead, I define an alias called `lg` where I use the `--pretty` option to [customize its output](https://git-scm.com/docs/pretty-formats). If you want to know more, I wrote about this a while ago when talking about the [importance of a good-looking history](http://megakemp.com/2014/08/14/the-importance-of-a-good-looking-history).
